        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          I go by Luna (My last name). I recently got started on learning how to
          code this year! I took a class on C++ a few years ago, and really
          enjoyed it, but I didn't know how to proceed after it. Seeing as I
          failed the second semester of it, I was pretty bummed out about it. A
          few years later my friend introduces me to JS with HTML and CSS, and
          it just reignited my drive to pursue this path.

          <h3>Coding & Debugging</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently in the process of learning how to code and debug. I'm
            not exactly new to the process but I'm picking up on everything
            pretty well it would seem. I look forward to future projects!

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p>
            Controler in hand since I was 2 years old. I've been gaming
            basically all my life. I play many different genres of games, but in
            mid 2018 I got hooked into the FGC (Fighting Game Community), and
            I've been loving Tekken 7 as well as many other games in the genre.
